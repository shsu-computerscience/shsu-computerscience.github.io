				<div class="filterDiv live"><q>[T]he cyber combat exercise allows teams to score points at the detriment of other teams. The organizers deliver “Intel” to the various servers under each team’s control. Stealing intel increases attack points, whereas having intel stolen decreases defense points. While each team is searching to find the vulnerabilities in the other teams’ servers, they must also take into account the security and availability of their own. In addition to the attack/defense scores, there is also a neutral, challenge-based competition to do on the side. Since each of the three aspects are weighted equally to form your final score, each team of four must have incredible cohesion and skill to effectively manage the multiple aspects. Due to our experience building our own infrastructure, we had a great deal of experience fixing vulnerable services and exploiting those vulnerabilities in other teams.</q></div>
				<div class="filterDiv policy"><q>The [policy] module focuses on public policy, which in the United States is quite complex. This part of the competition begins with the judges providing you with a fictional scenario where a large government contractor was hacked. The implications of the hack were massive, and it took an in-depth review of multiple legal documents and federal policies to navigate best on how we should recommend to the president to respond.</q></div>
